    Applies a constraint that the passed in SymInt must lie between min-max
    inclusive-inclusive, WITHOUT introducing a guard on the SymInt (meaning
    that it can be used on unbacked SymInts).  If min/max are None, we assume
    that the dimension is unbounded in that direction.  Repeated application
    of constrain_range intersects the ranges.  This is a fairly low level API
    that doesn't have a lot of safety guarantees (TODO: provide higher level
    APIs).

    Currently, we use this API in the following circumstance: when we allocate
    an unbacked SymInt, denoting an integer quantity which is data dependent,
    we ordinarily do not know anything about what values it may take.  This
    means that any sort of guard on it will immediately fail.  However, in
    many cases, we know something about the unbacked SymInt: for example, we
    know that nonzero(x).size(0) must be >= 0.  We use constrain_range to
    narrow the possible range, declaring that negative symbols are impossible.
    This permits to definitely answer True to queries like 'nnz >= 0', even if
    we don't know what the actual (hinted) value of 'nnz' is.  In fact, we
    actually use constrain_range to unsoundly discharge common guards: for an
    unbacked SymInt produced by nonzero, we will also assume that it is not
    equal to 0/1 (even though these are perfectly possible values at runtime),
    because we generally expect graphs that are valid for N=2 to also be valid
    for N=1.

        If you use constrain_range in the context of tracing, we do NOT check
        that the constraint was actually valid at runtime!  In fact, we
        cannot (easily) do so, as we currently unsoundly assume that unbacked
        SymInt can never be zero/one, even if it may actually take on these

# note [Tensor Fakification and Symbol Caching]
#
# As of the time of this note, dynamo creates a fresh fake tensor mode for backends.
# The reason we do this is because there are certain classes of operations, namely,
# metadata mutations, that change tensor size, stride, etc. This means that the fake tensor
# state at the end of a dynamo trace is different than the fake tensor state at the beginning
# of a trace. Backends like aot_autograd need a fresh fake tensor to correctly track metadata mutation,
# view relationships, etc.
#
# As we create a new fake mode, we also lose the memoization that comes with it. Rather than
# transfer the memoization cache, we instead transfer the shape env. However, with this
# comes nuance - as dynamo is selective in how it makes symbolic shapes. Due to strategies in
# automatic dynamic and constraints, the policy for which dims are dynamic is nuanced and varies across
# recompilations.
#
# In order to preserve the symbolic decisions made during dynamo tensor fakification, we pass
# a StatefulSymbolicContext at creation time. This object is tracked, per tensor, on the TracingContext.
# The lifecycle of this object should match the lifecycle of the original dynamo tracked tensor, and it is
# safe to reuse this object as many times as necessary to create a fake tensor. Fake tensors
# created with new fake modes should produce the same exact symbols as the original, providing the same shape_env
# is used.

        #   if x == True:

        #    - "x == False" (always works for any size y)

        # 2. opt_f(True, y):
        #    - Triggers recompilation and results in guards like:
        #      - "x == True and y.size(0) == 4"
        #      - (or "y.size(0) == 4 and x == True")

        # If True branch guard check precedes False branch and for True branch, y.size(0) check precedes x == True,

        # It took a lot of sweat to figure out the algorithm here.  Let's
        # explain how it works.
        #
        # The ShapeEnv lifecycle looks something like this:
        #
        # - For each input, you either generate a fresh Sympy symbol (s0) to
        #   represent its value (a binding site), or you reuse some
        #   preexisting symbol or expression, skipping the symbol allocation
        #   (e.g., duck sizing to a preexisting symbol, or expressing a
        #   stride as a multiplication of a separate stride and size.)
        #   Naively, you might expect to bind a fresh Sympy symbol for
        #   every input, but this is fairly wasteful as most of these
        #   symbols immediately simplify away, and if you don't eagerly
        #   specialize, e.g., 0/1 symbols, you end up with very complicated
        #   expressions that are not optimizable in practice.
        #
        # - You perform some compute on these symbols, occasionally
        #   introducing guards on boolean expressions on these symbols.
        #   In particular, whenever we guard on equality (_maybe_guard_eq),
        #   we can simplify shapes; e.g., when s0 == s1 * 2, we can now
        #   replace all occurrences of s0 with s1 * 2.  Sometimes, a
        #   boolean expression evaluation doesn't introduce a guard, as
        #   the guard is already entailed by the simplifications we have
        #   applied.
        #
        # - In the end, you have a bunch of replacements (saying how to
        #   simplify shapes) and a bunch of guards (all the equality guards
        #   are trivial, because they're covered by the replacements).
        #
        # From the ShapeEnv, we must generate a Python expression that, when
        # evaluated on a set of inputs, tells us whether or not these boolean
        # expressions would have evaluated in the same way.  However,
        # we cannot easily compute this, as we elide recording boolean
        # expressions when we think they are vacuously true.  Thus, we seek
        # an approximation: we must generate an expression, if true, would have
        # produced an "equivalent" ShapeEnv, which would answer guard
        # expressions in the same way.
        #
        # Our notion of equivalence is a bit subtle.  For example, consider
        # the ShapeEnv created from an input of size (5, 4) versus (4, 4)
        # (no other guards.)  Duck sizing would generate (s0, s1) in the first
        # case but (s0, s0) in the second.  We do NOT assume that size
        # variables are disjoint; so in fact a graph that assumes the input
        # could be (s0, s1) subsumes (s0, s0) (setting s0 == s1), but not
        # vice versa.  However, consider an analogous case (1,) versus (2,).
        # Duck sizing generates (1,) and (s0,); the (s0,) graph does NOT
        # subsume the (1,) graph because we assume that any size variables
        # is NOT 0/1 (and make simplifications according to this; e.g., if
        # we queried s0 == 0, we would immediately return False without
        # returning a guard.)
        #
        # So, it is perhaps easier to flip things on their head: the guard
        # expressions we generate here say what simplifications are valid,
        # and what are not.  Below, we explain each of the guard expressions
        # we generate
